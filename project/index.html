        <h2>Truck Performance and Capabilities</h2>
        <p>
          Modern trucks, especially models like the Ford F150, F250, and Chevrolet Silverado, offer robust towing
          capabilities, high payloads, and strong engines designed for durability. Many trucks today come with advanced
          technology, including enhanced suspension and powerful torque, to support heavy-duty tasks and long-haul
          driving.

        <h2>AWD vs. 4x4: Understanding the Difference</h2>
        <p>
          All-Wheel Drive (AWD) and 4x4 systems both improve traction, but they work differently. AWD is typically
          full-time, automatically distributing power to all wheels as needed, making it ideal for varying road
          conditions. On the other hand, 4x4 (four-wheel drive) usually offers selectable modes for on-road or off-road
          driving, providing more control in extreme conditions. AWD is often best for general road use, while 4x4
          shines
          in off-road or rugged environments.

      <h2 class="gallery-title">Utah's Weather: Preparing for the Drive</h2>
      <div class="gallery">
        <p>
          Utah weather varies greatly by season and region. Winters can be snowy and cold, especially in mountain areas,
          where snowfall impacts driving conditions. Salt Lake City and Provo see moderate winter conditions, but rural
          and mountainous areas can become challenging for drivers. In the summer, temperatures can reach the high 90s°F
          in the valleys. With these varying conditions, having a reliable AWD or 4x4 vehicle ensures you're prepared
          for
          snow in winter and the occasional dirt trail in summer.
        </p>
        <p>
          To stay safe on Utah's roads, check weather forecasts regularly, and be mindful of mountain passes and canyon
          areas that can be hazardous in winter. Many drivers switch to winter tires or keep snow chains on hand during
          colder months for added security.

    <!-- Driving with AWD and 4x4 in Utah -->
    <aside class="aside-content">
      <h2>Why AWD and 4x4 are Ideal for Utah</h2>
      <p>
        With Utah’s diverse landscape, from deserts to mountainous regions, AWD and 4x4 systems provide an edge in
        handling the state’s varying terrains. Vehicles with these capabilities allow drivers to venture through Utah's
        scenic routes confidently, whether on snowy roads in winter or sandy trails in the summer. For drivers looking
        to
        explore beyond the city limits, having AWD or 4x4 is often essential.
